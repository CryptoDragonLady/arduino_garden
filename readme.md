Simple 3 zone sensor/pump arduino watering setup for my Tent Garden, Based on andrewmegaris/arduino_garden.

If you've done a single search for the terms "Arduino" and "Garden" I can imagine you were probably as surprised as I was at the 30 some pages of results. 

I made it through about 8. 

The one thing that stood out to me, was they were either WAAAAAY over the top complicated for what I need/want -- Or they're just bad. Or not really enough. Or, or, or.. 

When I came across this one I raised a nerdy eyebrow and thought this is about perfect. I actually have to remove just a few extra things I dont need. Not half the codebase. 

So as I go through this project, i will be refactoring the code, with the goal of readability and usability and I will also try to comment it better to make it easier for newbies to grok. 

Hopefully, by the time YOU find this, it will be closer to done than where I am now, just starting. 

Edits to this to come as progress gets made.
